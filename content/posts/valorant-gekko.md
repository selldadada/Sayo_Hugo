### Initiator  

- **Gekko commands a team of unique creatures to stun, blind, and detain enemies. His abilities allow him to clear corners, disrupt enemies, and provide strong utility for his team. Unlike other Initiators, Gekkoâ€™s abilities can be reused by retrieving his creatures after theyâ€™re deployed, making him a highly versatile agent.**

## Gekkoâ€™s Abilities
### 1. Dizzy (E) â€“ Vision Denial (Flash)
> - Sends Dizzy, a small creature that flies forward and blasts enemies in its vision, blinding them.
> - After use, Dizzy turns into a glob that Gekko can pick up to use again later.
### 2. Wingman (Q) â€“ Intel Gathering & Spike Utility
> - Sends Wingman forward to stun the first enemy he sees.
> - If Gekko has the Spike, Wingman can plant or defuse it, making him the only agent with this ability.
> - After use, Wingman turns into a glob that Gekko can retrieve.
### 3. Mosh Pit (C) â€“ Area Denial (Grenade)
> - Throws Mosh, who creates a large green puddle that explodes after a short delay, dealing massive damage.
> - Great for clearing corners, stopping Spike plants/defuses, or forcing enemies out of position.
### 4. Thrash (X â€“ Ultimate) â€“ Crowd Control (Detain)
> - Controls Thrash, a creature that lunges forward and detonates, detaining all enemies hit (like Killjoyâ€™s ultimate but smaller range).
> - After use, Thrash turns into a glob that Gekko can pick up and re-use once more during the round.

- **Control space with Mosh Pit:** Block enemy movement or clear tight spots.
- **Use Thrash wisely:** Detaining enemies can win rounds instantly.
- **Pick up ability globs:** Reusing abilities gives Gekko a huge advantage.
