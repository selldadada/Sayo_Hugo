**2. Game Modes**
   - *Unrated* ‚Äì Standard game mode with no rank impact.
   - *Competitive* ‚Äì Ranked matches with Elo-based matchmaking.
   - *Spike Rush* ‚Äì Shorter 4-round matches with random weapons.
   - *Deathmatch* ‚Äì Free-for-all practice for aiming.
   - *Escalation* ‚Äì A casual mode where players level up weapons as they progress.
   - *Custom Games* ‚Äì Private lobbies for practice or scrims.

## Essential Gameplay Tips üéÆ

### Aiming & Crosshair Placement
- Always aim at head level for quick eliminations.
- Use aim trainers like Aim Lab or Kovaak‚Äôs to improve.
- Practice counter-strafing (stopping before shooting for accuracy).

### Movement & Peeking
- Don't run while shooting; accuracy is bad when moving.
- Strafe and stop before firing for accurate shots.
- Use jiggle peeking and angle clearing to avoid getting killed easily.

### Map Awareness & Communication
- Learn common callouts (e.g., Heaven, A Main, Garage).
- Use pings (Z key) if you don‚Äôt have a mic.
- Always check the minimap to see teammates and enemy locations.

### Utility Usage
- Don‚Äôt waste abilities at the start; use them to gain control.
- Smoke enemy sightlines and flash before entering a site.
- Save your ultimate for important rounds (e.g., retakes, executes).
